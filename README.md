## User Story
As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

## Purpose

The purpose of the homework is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file that accepts a user's input using the Inquirer package. The application will run in the terminal by using the command "node index.js". Upon completion of the app, a README.md file will automatically be generated.

The criteria for the assignment are as follows:

1) When a user is prompted for information about the application repository then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the project title and sections entitled Table of Contents, Description, Installation, Usage, Contributors, Tests, License, and Questions.
2) When the user enters a project title then it is displayed as the title of the README.
3) When the user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributors, and Tests.
4) When a user enters a GitHub username then it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile.
5) When a user enters an email address then it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions.
6) When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents then the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README.
